## What is a Gold Legend Award?

Our community members work hard to solve the problem of managing code-level vulnerabilities in modern application architecture. The Ortelius community recognizes our members who have contributed via technical efforts or outreach efforts. There are a few select individuals who do both. Those members we call Legends. 

To recognize these outstanding individuals, the Ortelius Recognition Program has two main tracks, with a third for those who are great at both:

- Champions: Focused on the technical aspects of open source involvement. Individuals who receive ‘Champion’ badges have achieved certain levels of expertise in coding, documentation, testing and design.

- Ambassadors: Focused on outreach, adoption and education, this group of individuals work on training, special events and end user communication. Individuals who receive these badges have achieved recognition for their commitment to building powerful content and community engagement.

- Legends: Some community members may participate in both Champion and Ambassador activities. We call these super stars “Legends.”

All 3 groups have Bronze, Silver and Gold levels of achievement. To become a Gold Legend, you must first receive a Champion Gold and an Ambassador Gold award. So in other words, it is hard to get to the Gold Legend level. 


## The Gold Legend Club

In 2023, the Ortelius community welcomed the first Gold Legend recipient, Utkarsh Sharma. Utkarsh Sharma proved that achieving this level was possible. In 2024, two more contributors received the honors. 

[Sacha Wharton](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sachawharton/) was awarded the Gold Legend Award on May 23, 2024. Sacha earned this award through his passion for platform engineering, both building and blogging about his journey. You can learn from Sacha through his "How to Bake" blog series:

Through this series of Blogs, Sacha provides insights into basic platform engineering skills, and shows contributors how to build their local environments. These lessons go beyond Ortelius and educates users on various tools needed for platform engineering. 

[Arvind Singharpuria](https://www.linkedin.com/in/arvind-singharpuria-a88686202/) earned his Gold Legend badge in December of 2024. Arvind started working with the Ortelius community as a contributor during his university years. Arvind was very new to software development, but he has a super power. Arvind has always been willing to step up and volunteer for coding that may be beyond his skill level, but he learns fast. Arvind has contributed code, worked on architecture design, and presented educational topics at the Ortelius SecureChainCon conferences, and during the Ortelius year end events. Arvind has an impeccable attendance record to both Architecture and Outreach meetings, and has become an invaluable contributor to the Ortelius project.
