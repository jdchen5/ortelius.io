## Recognizing our Members for Their Hard Work

Our community members are dedicated to tackling the challenges of continuous vulnerability management. As an open-source project, we operate with limited funding for swag, but we deeply value the contributions of those who support our mission through technical efforts, outreach, or both.

To honor these exceptional individuals, we have established the Ortelius Recognition Program. Contributors who meet specific criteria will earn an award badge as a token of our appreciation. Participation is open to everyone, regardless of expertise level. There are two main tracks for involvement:

Champions: This track recognizes contributors who excel in the technical aspects of open-source involvement. Champions demonstrate expertise in areas such as coding, documentation, testing, and design, earning badges that reflect their achievements.

Ambassadors: This track highlights individuals focused on outreach, adoption, and education. Ambassadors are instrumental in training, organizing special events, and fostering communication with end-users. Their badges signify a commitment to creating impactful content and driving community engagement.
Through this program, we celebrate the dedication and hard work of our community members who help make Ortelius a success.

Some community members may participate in both Champion and Ambassador activities. We call these super stars "Legends."

All 3 groups have Bronze, Silver and Gold levels of achievement. Below are links to the criteria for achieving each of the badges.
