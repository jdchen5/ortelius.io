## Full-spectrum OS Package Visibility 

The fragmented structure of decoupled cloud-native architectures creates operational blind spots, often weakening IT teams' ability to counter threats swiftly and decisively. Unlike monolithic applications, cloud-native systems may generate hundreds of Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) reports scattered across numerous source code repositories, complicating threat detection and response.

Ortelius acts as a force multiplier, aggregating SBOM data across these decentralized architectures to deliver full-spectrum visibility, security, and compliance in modern software operations. In distributed systems where services, applications, and components function independently, each element brings its own dependencies, vulnerabilities, and licensing challenges.

By consolidating SBOM data, Ortelius provides a unified operational picture of all software components and their supply chains. It empowers organizations to detect risks early, neutralize vulnerabilities proactively, and maintain mission-critical regulatory compliance. This centralized command and control capability enhances your security posture, eliminates blind spots, and ensures your entire architecture remains fortified and mission-ready, even in the face of distributed complexities.

The Ortelius aggregated SBOM is a vital asset for achieving compliance with [Executive Order 14028 - Improving the Nation's Cybersecurity](https://www.gsa.gov/technology/it-contract-vehicles-and-purchasing-programs/information-technology-category/it-security/executive-order-14028).

## A Battle-ready Software Supply Chain

Leveraging its stored SBOM data, Ortelius conducts ongoing surveillance for new vulnerabilities that may surface long after a container has been deployed. This continuous vulnerability scanning is a critical defense measure, as software systems are dynamic and constantly evolving, with new threats emerging regularly. As developers roll out updates, introduce fresh code, or incorporate third-party components, unforeseen vulnerabilities can infiltrate the system.

By maintaining persistent scanning operations of OSV.dev, Ortelius enables organizations to detect potential weaknesses immediately upon discovery, allowing for rapid countermeasures and minimizing the hackerâ€™s window of opportunity. Continuous scanning for new vulnerabilities ensures your defenses remain current, fortifying against breaches and maintaining compliance with security protocols in an ever-shifting threat environment. This proactive approach secures your operational landscape, keeping your software supply chain resilient and battle-ready.
