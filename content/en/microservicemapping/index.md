## Control Threats Across Your Supply Chain

Take command of potential threats emerging from your [open-source software security](https://www.deployhub.com/open-source-software-security/) gaps with Ortelius. Ortelius guarantees you maintain an ironclad, up-to-date inventory of all open-source components within your software supply chain, enabling rapid, tactical decisions regarding open-source deployment across your entire operational theater, from code to cloud.

Ortelius delivers swift visibility on the deployment of open-source package versions across your infrastructure. A quick search on any package and version reveals a comprehensive inventory of its presence and usage.
This capability provides your teams with the critical intel required to evaluate the operational impact of CVEs and swiftly deploy resources to neutralize vulnerabilities, pinpointing exactly where CVE patches are urgently needed.

## Evaluate OS Package OpenSSF Scorecard

[OpenSSF Scorecard](https://scorecard.dev/) is a tactical security tool developed by the [Open Source Security Foundation](https://www.openssf.org) (OpenSSF) to conduct automatic assessments of the security posture of open-source projects. By executing a series of automated checks, it evaluates how closely a project adheres to security best practices, empowering developers and organizations to understand and mitigate the security risks tied to the open-source software in their arsenal.

The Scorecard evaluates critical mission areas, such as:

- Code review practices: Ensures all code changes undergo thorough review before integration.
- Branch protection: Confirms that critical branches are safeguarded.
- Dependency management: Assesses how effectively the project manages and updates external dependencies.
- Security policy: Verifies the presence of a defined and actionable security policy.
- Vulnerability reporting: Ensures processes are in place for promptly reporting and addressing security vulnerabilities.

Each project is assigned a security score, allowing for direct comparison of the security readiness of various open-source projects. This tool is essential for organizations aiming to maintain operational security and mitigate risks across their open-source software supply chain.

Ortelius integrates seamlessly with OpenSSF Scorecard, providing a centralized command view of security assessments for every component within your software supply chain.
