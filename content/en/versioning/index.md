### Track the Impact of Changes with Precision


Ortelius equips teams with the tactical tools needed to track and monitor the flow of changes through the CI/CD pipeline in a decoupled architecture. It delivers mission-critical intel on why and by whom an artifact—such as a container, API, or microservice—was updated and identifies the operational units impacted by the change. By embedding DevSecOps data directly into the CI/CD pipeline, Ortelius ensures that the impact of changes is assessed and tracked with precision.

Each change poses potential threats from new open-source packages, which may carry vulnerabilities. With hundreds of thousands of vulnerabilities discovered annually, prioritizing and neutralizing critical ones is essential. Ortelius generates comparative reports and calculates the "blast radius" of every shared component, detailing the associated open-source package risks. It consolidates this intelligence at the logical application level, providing strategic insights into both individual components and integrated systems deployed to end users.

## Tracking Components Across All Attack Surfaces

The Ortelius vulnerability intelligence repository tracks component versions that collectively form application versions. Each time a component is updated, a new logical version of all consuming applications is generated, accompanied by updated SBOMs and CVE analyses. These version updates are directly tied to the deployment environments, providing a comprehensive inventory of components across all attack surfaces. 

Because components include versions of open-source packages derived from their SBOMs, Ortelius delivers pinpoint accuracy in identifying where each open-source package is deployed. This visibility equips CISO teams with the actionable intelligence needed to rapidly assess risks and respond decisively to supply chain security threats.
