# Contribute

The Ortelius Team needs you. Regardless of your previous involvement in an open source community, you can help.  From outreach, project management, testing and core developers, Ortelius has a place for anyone interested in working on an open source project. And most important are our Ortelius Adopters. They are responsible for defining our roadmap and keeping us honest.

## Why Contribute to Ortelius

- We want Members to learn and understand cloud-native development and learn to overcome the challenges through mentorship and a diverse contributor base.
- We want Members to learn how to harden their cybersecurity through the consumption of SBOM and CVE data.
- We want our members to develop their careers, skills and gain community recognition for their work and expertise.
- We want our members to improve their knowledge around managing code-level vulnerabilities through patch remediation.
- We want members to learn how to contribute to an open source community and become part of the broader conversation around cloud native architecture.
